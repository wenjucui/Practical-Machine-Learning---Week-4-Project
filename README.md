## Foreword
Thank you for reviewing my assignment! You can download the repo, and will be able to view the compiled HTML file. 


## Course Project Instructions (from course site on Coursera)

Background

Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website here: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset). 
Data

The data for this project come from this source: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har. (this link does not work though. I searched on the course discussion forums, many students mentioned this, but no final solutions) If use the document for this class for any purpose please cite them as they have been very generous in allowing their data to be used for this kind of assignment. 

What to submit

The goal of this project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. This is the "classe" variable in the training set. Use any of the other variables to predict with. Create a report describing how the model was built, how cross validation was performed, what the expected out of sample error is, and why the choices were made. Use the prediction model to predict 20 different test cases.
